## 🌍 Why Do I Travel?
As an AI researcher and globe-trotter who has stamped his passport in ~80 countries, I often get asked:  
*"Why do you travel?"*  
From diving with sharks in Fiji to sipping natural wine in Corsica, every journey is a story. Travel, like AI, is about curiosity, discovery, and understanding complexity. If I ever start another PhD, it might be on the psychology of travel—powered by AI.

## 🧠 What I Do
I design **trustworthy, efficient, and impactful AI systems** bridging academic rigor and industrial scale.  
My research spans:
- **Bias & Fairness in AI** – Making models equitable and transparent.
- **Sustainable & Frugal AI** – Optimizing resources for real-world deployments.
- **Metric & Similarity Learning** – Multi-view learning and information fusion.
- **AI in Industry** – Scalable solutions for travel, operations, and personalization.
