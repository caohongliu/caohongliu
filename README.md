## 🌍 Who Am I?
As an AI researcher and globe-traveller who has stamped my passport in ~80 countries:
- I trek across landscapes of optimisation, and across glaciers in the Arctic
- I dive deep into bias and fairness in AI, and occasionally into the Pacific with sharks,
- I surf the waves of algorithmic complexity, and nice waves in Gold Coast
- I sail through semantic and similarity spaces, and across the Mediterranean chasing sunsets

## 🧠 What I Do
I design **trustworthy, efficient, and impactful AI systems** bridging academic rigor and industrial scale.  
My research spans:
- **Bias & Fairness in AI** – Making models equitable and transparent including Computer Vision, Biometric systems, embedding models and LLMs.
- **Sustainable & Frugal AI** – Optimizing resources for real-world deployments, reducing the carbon footprints and costs.
- **Metric Learning & Information Fusion** – Exploring the similarity learning for Multi-view learning, human perceptions, etc.  
- **AI in Industry** – Scalable solutions for travel, operations, and personalization.
